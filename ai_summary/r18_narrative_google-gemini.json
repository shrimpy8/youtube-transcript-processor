{"success":true,"summaries":[{"provider":"google-gemini","modelName":"Google Gemini 2.5 Flash","summary":"### Opening\nZevy Arnowitz, a Product Manager at Meta with no technical background, shared his journey and innovative workflows for building products using AI. The conversation highlighted how AI tools are transforming product development, enabling non-technical individuals to become builders, and emphasizing the importance of continuous learning and strategic AI integration. Zevy asserted that the era of AI means \"everyone's going to become a builder\" and that \"titles are going to collapse and responsibilities are going to collapse.\"\n\n### Key Ideas\nZevy's personal revelation came with the advent of AI, making him feel like he \"had superpowers now\" and inspiring him to build. He initially leveraged GBD and Claude projects, which he described as shared chat folders with custom instructions and knowledge bases, to compartmentalize different aspects of his life and work. This approach was a direct response to the \"memory feature\" of early AI models, which often mixed contexts, leading to irrelevant suggestions. He found that early AI-powered coding tools like Bolt and Lovable were \"super eager to write code,\" often skipping crucial planning stages and resulting in \"terrible things\" and \"gnarly bugs\" when dealing with complex features like payments or database changes.\n\nTo mitigate these issues, Zevy developed a unique \"CTO\" persona within his AI project, a custom prompt that instructed the AI to act as the \"complete technical owner\" of the project. This AI CTO was programmed to \"challenge me\" and \"don't want you to be a people pleaser,\" contrasting sharply with the \"sickopantic\" nature of standard ChatGPT, which he humorously noted would be the \"worst CTO\" for its tendency to agree with \"dumbest ideas.\" This strategic prompting ensures that technical decisions are thoroughly vetted, preventing premature coding and fostering a more robust development process. For non-technical individuals, Zevy advised a gradual \"exposure therapy\" approach to AI coding tools, starting with user-friendly platforms like GPT projects, then progressing to Bolt or Lovable, and eventually to more powerful, direct coding environments like Cursor in \"light mode\" before embracing full \"dark mode\" development. He transitioned to Cursor with Claude code when he \"outgrew\" simpler tools, seeking more control over the development process.\n\nZevy's current workflow in Cursor, powered by Claude code, is a structured, multi-stage process driven by custom \"slash commands.\" It begins with `/create issue`, which quickly captures a feature idea or bug in Linear, allowing him to stay in flow. This is followed by an `/exploration phase`, where Claude analyzes the codebase and the issue, asking clarifying questions. Once the problem is deeply understood, the `/create plan` command generates a detailed markdown file, including a TLDDR (Too Long; Didn't Read), critical decisions, and concise, trackable tasks. This modular plan allows him to leverage different AI models for their specific strengths, such as Gemini 3 for UI components or Cursor's Composer for rapid execution. The actual coding is initiated with an `execute` command, with Composer being remarkably fast.\n\nA critical and innovative aspect of Zevy's workflow is the multi-model code review process, addressing the challenge of reviewing AI-generated code. After manual QA, he uses `/review` to have Claude examine its own work. What truly sets his approach apart is the \"peer review\" stage, where he employs multiple LLMs—Claude, Codeex (ChatGPT's competitor), and Cursor's Composer—to review the *same code*. He then uses a `/peer review` command, positioning Claude as the \"dev lead\" who must either justify or fix issues identified by the other \"team leads\" (models). Zevy personifies these models, seeing Claude as a communicative and collaborative dev lead, Codeex as a non-communicative but brilliant bug-fixer, and Gemini as an artsy but chaotic designer. This strategy, he explains, involves \"playing to their strengths and mitigating their weaknesses by using other models.\" The final stage involves updating documentation to ensure future AI agents write better code.\n\n### Practical Takeaways\nFor practitioners, Zevy's workflow offers a clear roadmap for effectively leveraging AI in product development. The systematic use of slash commands for issue creation, exploration, planning, and execution streamlines the process, making it accessible even for non-technical PMs. The multi-model peer review technique is a powerful best practice for ensuring code quality and catching errors that a single AI or human might miss. Furthermore, Zevy emphasizes the crucial role of \"constant post-mortems.\" When AI makes a mistake, he prompts it to introspectively analyze \"what in your system prompt or tooling made you make this mistake?\" and then updates the documentation or prompts accordingly. This iterative refinement of AI's \"tooling and documentation\" is, for him, \"one of the biggest hacks for productivity,\" distinguishing proficient AI users from casual ones.\n\nZevy also shared valuable career and mindset tips related to AI. He strongly advocates for viewing AI as a \"collaborative learning opportunity\" rather than a threat to skills. He believes AI acts as a perpetually available, non-judgmental mentor, enabling junior PMs to gain \"reps\" and operate at a \"higher level\" by exploring strategic and marketing decisions typically reserved for senior roles. His advice for aspiring PMs, drawn from his own early career failures, is to be a \"10x learner\" rather than striving to be a \"10x PM\" from day one. This learning-first mindset, combined with AI's capabilities, allows individuals to build significant products independently, transforming them into \"builders\" who can offer immense value to companies, especially if they are \"curious, optimistic, hardworking, kind, and good communicators.\"\n\n### Closing Thought\nZevy's insights reveal a future where AI empowers individuals, regardless of technical background, to innovate and build at unprecedented speeds. By embracing AI as a strategic partner for ideation, development, and quality assurance, and by cultivating a continuous learning mindset, practitioners can navigate the evolving landscape of product development, ensuring they are among \"someone who's better at using AI than you.\" This new paradigm not only democratizes building but also fosters a deeper understanding of the product development lifecycle through active collaboration with intelligent agents.","success":true}]}
