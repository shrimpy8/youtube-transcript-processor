{"success":true,"summaries":[{"provider":"google-gemini","modelName":"Google Gemini 2.5 Flash","summary":"- Non-technical PMs can gain building confidence by gradually moving from **GPT projects** to tools like **Bolt** or **Lovable**, and then to **Cursor** with **Claude** for more control [00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=782s)\n- A core workflow involves a series of reusable **slash commands** saved within the codebase to guide AI through development, including creating issues, exploration, planning, execution, and review [00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=909s)\n- The initial step in the workflow is to use a `/create issue` slash command to quickly capture a bug or feature idea in **Linear** so development flow isn't interrupted [00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=921s)\n- The exploration phase uses a `/exploration phase` slash command to prompt **Claude** to deeply understand the problem, analyze the codebase, and ask clarifying questions before implementation [00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=1454s)\n- A `/learning opportunity` slash command helps non-technical users learn complex concepts by instructing **Claude** to explain technical details using the 80/20 rule, priming it as a mid-level engineering mentor [00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=1714s)\n- The `/create plan` slash command generates a detailed markdown plan from a template, including critical decisions and tasks with status trackers, which can then be used by different AI models for execution [00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=1762s)\n- Different AI models excel at different tasks: **Claude** is a communicative and opinionated \"dev lead\" for planning, **Codeex** is a \"dark room coder\" for complex bugs, and **Gemini** is an \"artsy scientist\" for UI design [00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=2460s)\n- To review code, manually QA first, then use a `/review` slash command for **Claude** to review its own work, and also have other models like **Codeex** and **Composer** perform independent reviews [00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=2369s)\n- A `/peer review` slash command takes review findings from other models and challenges the primary agent (**Claude**) to either explain why the issues aren't real or fix them, fostering a \"fight it out\" dynamic [00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=2399s)\n- Continuously update AI's system prompts, tooling, and documentation by asking it to reflect on mistakes and identify root causes, ensuring it learns and avoids repeating errors [00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=2787s)\n- For larger companies, make the codebase AI-native with markdown files explaining structure and areas, allowing PMs to potentially build contained UI projects or create PRs for engineers to finalize [00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=3091s)\n- Relying on AI tools should not lead to skill atrophy if used intentionally as a collaborative learning opportunity, treating AI as a constant mentor that helps develop higher-level PM skills [00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=3330s)\n- To avoid \"AI slop,\" provide AI with clear guidelines, context on your style, and the problem you're solving, similar to how you would guide a junior team member [00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=3462s)\n- AI can be effectively used for job interview prep by creating a \"coach\" project, feeding it with best practices, doing mock interviews, and analyzing question banks to prioritize study [00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=3556s)\n- Embrace a \"10x learner\" mindset, especially as a junior, by seeking mentorship from peers and AI to accelerate growth and contribute significant value [01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=3881s)","success":true}]}
