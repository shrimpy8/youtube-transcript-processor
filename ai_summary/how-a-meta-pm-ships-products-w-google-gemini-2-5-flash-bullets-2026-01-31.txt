- Non-technical product managers can build significant products using AI tools by starting with **GPT projects** for learning and gradually graduating to more powerful tools like **Bolt**, **Lovable**, and eventually **Cursor** with **Claude Code** [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=316s)
- A "CTO" project with custom prompts can mitigate common AI issues like being a "people-pleaser," ensuring the AI challenges ideas and takes technical ownership [00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=255s)
- The core workflow for building products with AI involves a series of reusable **slash commands** for creating issues, exploration, planning, execution, review, and documentation updates [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=385s)
- The **`create issue`** slash command quickly captures a bug or feature idea, asking brief clarifying questions to generate a detailed **Linear** ticket, allowing the PM to stay in flow [00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=526s)
- The **`exploration phase`** slash command takes a **Linear** ticket as an argument, allowing the AI to fetch and analyze the issue, understand the codebase, and ask clarifying questions to ensure deep problem understanding [00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=613s)
- A **`learning opportunity`** slash command can be used to explain complex technical concepts using the 80/20 rule, priming **Claude** to act as a mid-level engineering mentor for a technical PM in the making [00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=724s)
- The **`create plan`** slash command generates a markdown file with a structured plan, including critical decisions and tasks, which is useful for tracking progress and for other AI models to execute specific parts [00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=742s)
- Different AI models can be leveraged for their strengths, such as **Cursor's Composer** for fast execution, **Gemini 3** for UI design, and **Claude** for planning and communicative CTO-like interactions [00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=767s)
- To ensure code quality, a multi-model peer review process involves having **Claude**, **Codeex**, and **Composer** independently review the code, then using a **`peer review`** slash command to have **Claude** (as the "dev lead") reconcile and address the findings [00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=992s)
- Regularly updating AI tooling and documentation is a major productivity hack; when an AI makes a mistake, ask it to reflect on the root cause and then update its system prompt or documentation to prevent recurrence [00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=1142s)
- AI can enhance PM skills by providing a "co-pilot" for ideation, strategy, and learning, allowing junior PMs to gain experience at a higher level and take on more responsibilities [00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=1348s)
- To reduce "AI slop," guide the AI with context on writing style and specific problem-solving approaches, similar to how one would guide a junior team member [00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=1363s)
- AI can be used to prepare for job interviews by creating an AI coach to mock interviews and analyze question banks, though human mocks remain critical for competitive roles [00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=1422s)
- The current era offers an "unfair advantage" for curious, hardworking, and communicative individuals to provide more value to companies than those with decades of experience, fostering a culture of continuous learning and building [00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=1615s)
