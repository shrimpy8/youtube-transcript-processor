### Opening

In this episode, Zevy Arnowitz, a product manager at Meta with zero technical background, walks through his remarkably sophisticated workflow for building production-ready software using AI tools like Cursor and Claude. What makes Zevy's story particularly striking is that just a year ago, he was traveling in Japan when he discovered AI coding tools—and the moment felt like being handed superpowers. Since then, he's built and shipped real products, including a profitable side business called Studymate, all without writing a single line of code himself.

### Key Ideas

Zevy's approach centers on a carefully structured series of "slash commands"—reusable prompts saved within his codebase that guide AI through each phase of product development. The workflow begins with issue capture. When he's mid-development and spots a bug or has a feature idea, he uses a `/create-issue` command that tells Claude to quickly capture the thought and format it as a Linear ticket. This keeps him in flow while ensuring ideas don't get lost. The command is designed for speed, instructing the AI to ask only essential clarifying questions before generating a properly formatted issue.

Once he's ready to tackle a feature, Zevy moves into exploration phase using `/exploration`. This step is critical—it's where the AI acts as a technical co-founder, deeply analyzing the codebase to understand current architecture, identifying which files need modification, and asking sophisticated clarifying questions about scope, data models, UX patterns, and validation logic. Zevy emphasized that this mirrors working with an engineering manager: the AI doesn't just start coding immediately, but instead challenges assumptions and ensures alignment on the approach. He's deliberately configured his prompts to avoid what he calls "ChatGPT-isms"—the people-pleasing tendency of AI to agree with everything. Instead, his system prompt instructs the AI to be opinionated and push back when needed.

After exploration comes planning with `/create-plan`. This generates a markdown file following a template Zevy found on Twitter, complete with a TLDR, critical decisions documented, and tasks broken into clear steps with status tracking. The markdown format is intentional: it allows him to split work across different AI models based on their strengths. He might use Cursor's Composer for backend work because it's blazingly fast, then hand the same plan to Gemini for frontend design work because it excels at UI. Having a written plan also becomes part of the codebase's institutional memory, helping future AI agents understand what's already been built in each area.

The execution phase is where code actually gets written, typically using `/execute-plan` with Cursor's Composer. Zevy demonstrated this live during the episode, building a fill-in-the-blank quiz feature for Studymate in just minutes—work that would take a human engineering team days. But what sets his workflow apart is what comes next: the review process. Because he can't manually review code effectively, he's developed a multi-model peer review system. He runs `/review` to have Claude examine its own work, then separately asks ChatGPT's Codex model and Cursor's Composer to review the same code. Each model has distinct characteristics—Claude is communicative and collaborative, Codex is the silent genius who solves gnarly bugs without explanation, and Gemini is the artistic scientist whose process looks terrifying but produces beautiful results.

The breakthrough move is the `/peer-review` command. After collecting feedback from multiple models, Zevy feeds it all back to Claude (the lead developer on the project) with a prompt that says: other team leads have reviewed your code and found issues, but don't take their feedback at face value—you have more context than they do, so either explain why they're wrong or fix the problems. This creates a dynamic where models essentially debate each other, with Claude sometimes getting "sassy" and pushing back when the same issue is raised multiple times. The result is a robust review process that catches mistakes a non-technical PM would never spot.

### Practical Takeaways

For anyone wanting to replicate this workflow, Zevy's advice is to start slow. Don't jump straight into Cursor if you've never looked at code—it will be overwhelming. Instead, begin with a ChatGPT project that acts as your technical co-founder. Give it a system prompt explaining that it owns all technical decisions while you own the product vision, and that you want it to challenge you rather than please you. Use this as exposure therapy to gradually get comfortable with technical concepts. Only after you've built comfort there should you graduate to tools like Bolt or Lovable, and eventually to Cursor.

The most powerful habit Zevy shared is conducting post-mortems on AI failures. When Claude makes a mistake or misunderstands something, he doesn't just fix it and move on. He asks the AI what in its system prompt or tooling caused the error, then updates documentation and slash commands so the mistake never happens again. This continuous improvement loop means his prompts and workflow get smarter over time, independent of model improvements. He also maintains a `/learning-opportunity` command that instructs Claude to explain complex technical concepts at his level, using the 80/20 rule to focus on what matters most. This turns every development session into a learning opportunity.

### Closing Thought

What makes Zevy's story so compelling isn't just the technical workflow—it's the mindset shift it represents. He described his generation as thinking "AI first" whenever facing any challenge, the same way today's children instinctively swipe on screens rather than press buttons. The barrier to building software has collapsed for curious, hardworking people willing to learn. As Zevy put it, this is the best time in history to be a junior, because you can graduate from school and build a startup completely on your own. The future belongs not to those who can code, but to those who can learn fastest—and AI makes that learning curve radically shorter for anyone willing to embrace it.
