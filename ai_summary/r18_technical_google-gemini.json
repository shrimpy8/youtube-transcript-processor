Workflows & Processes\n\n#### AI-Assisted Product Building Workflow\nThis comprehensive workflow is used by the speaker to build features for his `Studymate` app, from ideation to deployment and documentation.\n1.  **Issue Creation (`/create-issue`)**:\n    *   **Purpose**: Quickly capture a bug, feature, or improvement idea without interrupting current development.\n    *   **Steps**:\n        *   Invoke `/create-issue` slash command in `Claude Code` (20:54).\n        *   Dictate the idea using `whisperflow` (20:50).\n        *   `Claude` asks brief clarifying questions to gather enough context (21:52).\n        *   `Claude` uses its tool-use capability (MCP) to create a `Linear` issue in a predefined format (22:12-22:28).\n    *   **Tools used**: `Claude Code`, `whisperflow`, `Linear`.\n    *   **Tips/Gotchas**: The issue created is a starting point, \"ready to start being explored\" rather than \"ready to be built\" (26:38-26:42).\n2.  **Exploration Phase (`/exploration-phase`)**:\n    *   **Purpose**: Deeply understand the problem, analyze the codebase, and determine the best technical implementation.\n    *   **Steps**:\n        *   Invoke `/exploration-phase` slash command, referencing the `Linear` ticket ID (e.g., `linear 88`) as an argument (23:38-24:05).\n        *   `Claude` fetches the `Linear` ticket (24:10).\n        *   `Claude` reads various code files to understand the basic structure and current state of the code (24:33).\n        *   `Claude` returns with its understanding of the codebase and a series of clarifying questions about scope, data model, UX/UI, validation, grading, and AI system prompt changes (27:24-27:59).\n        *   The user provides answers to these questions (28:02-28:06).\n    *   **Tools used**: `Claude Code`, `Linear`.\n    *   **Tips/Gotchas**: This phase is crucial for serious app building, requiring significant back-and-forth for deep understanding (28:26). Use the `/learning-opportunity` command to understand difficult concepts during this phase (28:32-29:06).\n3.  **Plan Creation (`/create-plan`)**:\n    *   **Purpose**: Generate a detailed, step-by-step technical plan for the feature implementation.\n    *   **Steps**:\n        *   Invoke `/create-plan` slash command (29:22).\n        *   `Claude` creates a markdown file based on a pre-defined template (found on Twitter), including a TLDDR, critical decisions, and broken-down tasks with status trackers (29:40-30:10).\n    *   **Tools used**: `Claude Code`.\n    *   **Tips/Gotchas**: The markdown plan is useful for splitting tasks among different models (e.g., `Gemini 3` for front-end, `Composer` for simple tasks) and for future agents to understand previous work (30:36-30:52).\n4.  **Plan Execution (`execute`)**:\n    *   **Purpose**: Generate and implement the code based on the created plan.\n    *   **Steps**:\n        *   Invoke `execute` command, tagging the plan file (31:06-31:12).\n        *   `Cursor`'s `Composer` model (or other chosen model) quickly writes the code (31:14-31:18).\n    *   **Tools used**: `Cursor` (`Composer`).\n    *   **Tips/Gotchas**: Composer is \"blazing fast\" (36:53).\n5.  **Code Review (`/review` and `/peer-review`)**:\n    *   **Purpose**: Identify and fix bugs and issues in the AI-generated code, especially for non-technical users.\n    *   **Steps**:\n        *   Manually QA the locally running app first (38:40, 39:21).\n        *   Invoke `/review` slash command in `Claude Code` to have it review its own work (39:29).\n        *   Have other models (`Codeex`, `Composer`) review the same code independently by instructing them to \"review all the code in this branch\" (39:43-44:29).\n        *   Collect the review findings from the different models.\n        *   Invoke `/peer-review` slash command in `Claude Code`, providing it with the findings from the other \"dev leads\" (models) (39:56-40:26).\n        *   Instruct `Claude` to either explain why the findings are not real issues or fix them itself, having the models \"fight it out\" until no more issues are found (40:26-40:37, 45:12-45:16).\n    *   **Tools used**: `Claude Code`, `Codeex`, `Cursor` (`Composer`).\n    *   **Tips/Gotchas**: Running reviews in multiple models catches different bugs due to their distinct characteristics (39:39-40:52). Use `/learning-opportunity` during this phase to understand complex issues (45:22-45:29).\n6.  **Documentation Update**:\n    *   **Purpose**: Improve documentation and tooling based on lessons learned from the development process, especially AI mistakes.\n    *   **Steps**:\n        *   After identifying a bug or execution failure, ask the AI what in its \"system prompt or tooling\" caused the mistake (46:38-46:47).\n        *   Update the AI's tooling, documentation, or system prompts based on this introspection to prevent future errors (46:49-46:53).\n    *   **Tools used**: `Claude Code` (or other primary AI agent).\n    *   **Tips/Gotchas**: This is a \"biggest hack for productivity\" and a \"biggest unlock\" for effective AI use (46:29, 47:19). It helps AI's responses \"get better\" over time (47:26-47:38).\n\n#### AI-Assisted Interview Preparation\n-   **Purpose**: Prepare for job interviews using AI as a coach and for practice.\n-   **Steps**:\n    *   Create a dedicated project (`Claude project`) to act as an interview \"coach\" (59:16-59:36).\n    *   Feed the project with \"all the best information out there\" on interview frameworks and tips (e.g., from Ben Arez's posts) (59:18-01:00:12).\n    *   Use the AI for mock interviews, asking it to provide feedback (01:00:16-01:02:05).\n    *   Use AI (e.g., `Perplexity's Comet browser`) to analyze online question banks (e.g., Lewis Lynn's) to prioritize common questions for mocks (01:01:28-01:01:51).\n    *   For questions without time to mock, ask `Claude` to \"play the candidate\" to learn from perfect answers (01:02:08-01:02:17).\n    *   Supplement AI mocks with human mock interviews, cold-outreaching to people on `LinkedIn` (01:00:21-01:00:37).\n    *   Build mini-apps (e.g., a quiz game in `Base 44`) to practice specific difficult concepts like segmentation (59:44-01:00:04).\n\n### 3. Tips, Techniques & Best Practices\n\n-   **Graduate AI tools gradually**: For non-technical users, start with simple AI interfaces like `GPT projects` (beautiful UI, simple), then move to more advanced app builders like `Bolt` or `Lovable`, and finally to powerful IDEs like `Cursor` (12:57-13:17).\n-   **Create an \"AI CTO\" project**: Establish a dedicated AI project (e.g., `GPT projects` or `Claude projects`) with an opinionated system prompt that tells the AI to act as a CTO. This AI should \"challenge\" the user, \"not be a people pleaser,\" and own the technical implementation, mitigating the \"sickopantic\" nature of general-purpose LLMs (09:53-10:25, 11:30-11:39).\n-   **Make your codebase \"AI-native\"**: Add plain text and markdown files within the codebase that explain high-level structure and how agents should work in certain areas. This helps AI agents navigate and understand the codebase more easily (51:28-51:52). This is a task for technical people (51:34-51:35).\n-   **Use multi-model reviews**: Employ different AI models (e.g., `Claude Code`, `Codeex`, `Composer`) to review the same code independently. Each model has distinct characteristics and will catch different issues, providing a more comprehensive review (00:45-00:51, 39:39-40:01, 43:39-44:35).\n-   **Conduct AI post-mortems**: When AI makes a mistake or fails to execute correctly, ask the AI to introspect and identify what in its \"system prompt or tooling\" caused the error. Then, update the relevant documentation, tooling, or prompts to prevent the mistake from recurring. This is a \"biggest hack for productivity\" and crucial for improving AI performance over time (46:02-47:38).\n-   **Leverage \"learning opportunity\" slash command**: When encountering difficult-to-understand technical concepts or code, use a slash command (e.g., `/learning-opportunity`) to prompt the AI to explain it using the 80/20 rule, tailored to a \"mid-level engineering knowledge\" persona (28:32-29:06, 45:22-45:29).\n-   **Play to model strengths**: Understand the distinct \"personalities\" and capabilities of different AI models and use them accordingly (e.g., `Claude` for collaborative communication, `Codeex` for fixing worst bugs, `Gemini` for UI/design) (40:43-43:06).\n-   **Own AI outputs**: Do not outsource thinking or blindly accept AI-generated content. Take responsibility for all outputs and ensure quality by guiding the AI with context (e.g., writing style, problem to solve) and reviewing its work (55:40-56:02, 57:13-57:52).\n-   **For PMs in larger companies**: Focus on contained UI projects or creating PRs for developers to finalize, rather than heavy database changes or big projects (52:03-52:15).\n-   **Be a 10x learner**: Especially for junior roles, prioritize learning and inquisitiveness. Don't rush into building. Use AI as a constant mentor and thought partner to accelerate learning and gain \"reps\" (01:00:41-01:00:55, 01:04:41-01:04:54, 01:06:06-01:06:08, 01:17:17-01:17:19).\n-   **Don't fear AI replacement**: Focus on becoming better at using AI, as those who master AI will replace those who don't (00:52-00:58, 01:02:32-01:02:47).\n\n### 4. Metrics & Numbers\n\n-   **Cost**: Speaker mentioned spending \"a couple bucks in AI credits\" per feature build (00:07:00-00:07:01).\n-   **Efficiency**:\n    *   \"Full features take minutes\" to build with `Composer` (36:58-37:00).\n    *   Localizing `Studymate` from Hebrew to English took \"two days,\" which would \"probably take a dev team weeks\" (35:17-35:23).\n    *   Building a personal site from no domain to live on a domain took \"an hour and a half\" (35:25-35:31).\n    *   The thermal clothing business made \"$4 a sale\" initially, then \"100% profit\" after negotiating directly with the importer (01:11:42-01:12:38).","success":true}]}
