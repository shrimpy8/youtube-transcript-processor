- Non-technical PM **Zevy Arnowitz** started building apps after watching YouTube videos on **Bolt** or **Lovable** during Sonnet 3.5 era, feeling like he gained superpowers [00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=172s)
- Create a **GPT project** as a **CTO** with custom prompt to own technical decisions, challenge ideas, and avoid people-pleasing behaviors like regular ChatGPT [00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=257s)
- Graduate gradually from **GPT projects** to **Bolt/Lovable** to **Cursor** with **Claude** for non-technical users via exposure therapy to code [00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=316s)
- Use **slash commands** in **Cursor** as reusable prompts for workflow: start with **/create-issue** to quickly capture bugs/features mid-development for **Linear** [00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=361s)
- Follow 6-step workflow in **Cursor**: create issue, **/explore** Linear ticket with clarifying questions on codebase/implementation, **/create-plan** as Markdown [00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=385s)
- Execute plan using fast models like **Cursor Composer** for simple tasks or split backend/frontend with **Gemini** for UI after reviewing Markdown plan [00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=787s)
- Manually QA built feature locally, then run **/review** in **Claude** to self-review code for bugs before multi-model reviews [00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=976s)
- Perform **peer review** by pasting reviews from **Codex**, **Composer**, etc., into **Claude** as dev lead to defend/fix issues across models [00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=991s)
- Use **/learning-opportunity** slash command to explain complex code via 80/20 rule, building technical knowledge as mid-level engineer [00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=724s)
- After reviews, run **post-mortems** by asking AI root cause of mistakes, then update docs/tooling/slash commands to prevent repeats and boost productivity [00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=1142s)
- Make codebases **AI-native** with Markdown explanations of structure for agents; PMs can ship contained UI via PRs for dev final review [00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=1250s)
- Own AI outputs as PM by guiding with context/style to avoid slop; use **/deslop** in **Cursor** and treat AI as always-available mentor [00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=1326s)
- Prep interviews with **Claude project** as coach using frameworks from Ben Arez, mock questions from banks, get harsh feedback, and learn perfect answers [00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=1408s)
- Juniors become 10x learners by seeking mentors for strengths, sharing early work; AI enables solo startups post-school [00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=1564s)
