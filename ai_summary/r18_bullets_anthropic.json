{"success":true,"summaries":[{"provider":"anthropic","modelName":"Anthropic Sonnet 4.5","summary":"- Non-technical PMs can build production apps by graduating from **GPT projects** to **Bolt** or **Lovable** to **Cursor** with **Claude** as their confidence grows, treating the progression as exposure therapy to code [00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=720s)\n\n- The 6-step AI dev workflow — create issue, explore, plan, execute, review, update docs — is driven entirely by reusable **slash commands** stored as prompts in the codebase [00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=911s)\n\n- **Slash create issue** captures feature ideas mid-development and automatically creates **Linear** tickets via **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) so you can stay in flow without context switching [00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=922s)\n\n- **Slash exploration phase** forces Claude to deeply understand the problem and ask clarifying questions before writing any code, preventing the \"eager coding\" mistakes that bolt and lovable make [00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=1480s)\n\n- **Slash create plan** generates a markdown file with TLDR, critical decisions, and task breakdown with status trackers that Claude updates as it works, enabling model-switching mid-project [00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=1766s)\n\n- Match AI models to tasks: **Claude** for planning and collaboration, **Gemini** for UI design (despite \"terrifying\" workflows), **Composer** for speed, **Codex** for complex bug fixing [00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=2460s)\n\n- Run **peer review** by having multiple models (Claude, Codex, Composer) review each other's code and then having Claude defend or fix issues as the \"dev lead\" who has the most context [00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=2401s)\n\n- After every bug or failure, ask Claude what in its system prompt or tooling caused the mistake, then update documentation so the error never recurs — this post-mortem habit is the biggest productivity unlock [00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=2792s)\n\n- **Slash learning opportunity** tells Claude to explain technical concepts at a mid-level engineering knowledge baseline using the 80/20 rule, turning every build into a learning session [00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=1712s)\n\n- Projects (GPT or Claude) compartmentalize context and prevent memory bleed across different life domains, making AI act like a focused CTO instead of a confused assistant mixing running advice with product reviews [00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=491s)\n\n- Prime your AI coach to challenge your thinking and not be a \"people pleaser\" — the worst CTO is one who agrees with your dumbest ideas like GPT claiming two unrelated frameworks are identical [00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=628s)\n\n- For interview prep, create a **Claude project** as your coach, feed it frameworks from experts like Ben Arez, mock with AI for feedback, then prioritize human mocks after analyzing question frequency using **Comet** browser agent on Lewis Lynn's question bank [00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=3561s)\n\n- The biggest mindset shift for juniors is realizing no one expects you to be a 10x PM — they expect you to be a 10x learner who maps each senior's strength (product sense, methodology, systems thinking) and consults them strategically [01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=3891s)\n\n- Making your codebase AI-native with plain-text markdown documentation explaining how to work in each area is the prerequisite for PMs to ship contained UI projects at larger companies [00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=3088s)\n\n- You won't be replaced by AI — you'll be replaced by someone who defaults to \"AI first\" for every new challenge, whether it's building features, prepping interviews, or analyzing competitor question banks [00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U&t=3543s)","success":true}]}
