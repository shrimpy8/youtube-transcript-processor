### Opening

In a truly remarkable conversation, Zevy Arnowitz, a Product Manager at Meta with a non-technical background, shared his innovative workflow for building significant products using AI tools. Joined by host Lenny, Zevy demystified how non-technical practitioners can harness the power of AI to ideate, plan, build, and refine applications, offering a compelling vision for the future of product development. The discussion centered on Zevy's clever and effective system that transforms complex coding into an accessible, collaborative process, enabling anyone to become a builder.

### Key Ideas

Zevy's journey into AI-powered building began after witnessing YouTube videos demonstrating app creation with AI tools like Bolt and Lovable, which felt like gaining "superpowers." He quickly realized the potential but also encountered limitations: these early tools were "super eager to write code," often leading to "terrible things" and "gnarly bugs" due to a lack of planning. To mitigate this, Zevy, despite having "zero technical background," developed a "CTO" custom prompt within a GPT project. This AI persona was tasked with being the "complete technical owner" of the project, challenging Zevy's assumptions and ensuring robust planning, rather than simply being a "people pleaser" like standard chatbots. This initial step allowed him to compartmentalize different aspects of his work and ensure technical rigor.

His current advanced workflow, primarily utilizing Cursor with Claude Code, is a structured, multi-stage process driven by custom "slash commands" – reusable prompts saved within the codebase. The process begins with `slash create issue`, which quickly captures a bug or feature idea and generates a Linear issue. This is followed by `slash exploration phase`, where Claude analyzes the issue and codebase, asking clarifying questions akin to an engineering manager. Once the problem is thoroughly understood, `slash create plan` generates a detailed markdown file outlining the implementation steps, critical decisions, and status trackers. This plan can even be divided, allowing specialized models like Gemini to handle UI aspects or Cursor's Composer for rapid execution.

A particularly innovative aspect of Zevy's workflow is the multi-layered review process. After the AI executes the plan, Zevy first manually QAs the feature. Then, he employs `slash review`, prompting Claude to review its own code. What's "even cooler" is his `peer review` command, where he involves multiple AI models, such as Codeex (GPT's model) and Composer, to independently review the code. Zevy likens this to having "other team leads within the company" review the work. Claude, acting as the "dev lead," is then presented with these external reviews and must either "explain why the stuff they found are not real issues and wrong or fix them yourself." This process leverages the distinct "personalities" of different models—Claude as the communicative, collaborative CTO; Codeex as the silent, efficient bug-fixer; and Gemini as the artistic but chaotic designer—to ensure comprehensive and robust code quality. The final step, `update docs`, ensures that all new features and learnings are documented, making the codebase more "AI native" and improving future agent performance.

Beyond building, Zevy emphasized continuous learning and refinement. He uses a `slash learning opportunity` command to have Claude explain complex technical concepts, priming it to teach a "technical PM in the making" with "mid-level engineering knowledge" using the 80/20 rule. Crucially, when AI makes mistakes, Zevy practices "constant post-mortems," asking the AI "what in your system prompt or tooling made you make this mistake." This introspection allows him to update prompts and documentation, ensuring the AI "never makes that mistake again," thereby continuously improving its intelligence and reliability. Zevy strongly disagrees with the notion that AI outsources thinking or leads to "slop," arguing instead that intentional use, clear guidance, and owning one's outputs make AI a powerful "game changer" that enhances a PM's craft, allowing even junior PMs to "play at such a higher level." This intentional approach also extended to his job interview preparation, where he used a Claude project as a "coach," feeding it frameworks, conducting mock interviews, and even creating a quiz game to practice segmentation, though he noted that "human mocks" remain critical.

### Practical Takeaways

For non-technical individuals looking to leverage AI in product development, Zevy's experience offers several concrete steps. Start gradually, perhaps with a "beautiful UI, super simple" GPT project, treating it as "exposure therapy" to become comfortable with code. Progress to more specialized tools like Bolt or Lovable, and eventually to powerful coding environments like Cursor, which offer greater control. Implement custom prompts to create "AI personas" like a CTO or engineering manager, ensuring the AI challenges your ideas and provides technical rigor. Embrace the workflow of `create issue`, `exploration phase`, `create plan`, `execute plan`, `review`, and `peer review`, using multiple AI models strategically to capitalize on their unique strengths.

Crucially, cultivate a "10x learner" mindset, as "no one expects you to know all the answers." Use commands like `learning opportunity` to deepen your understanding of technical concepts. When AI inevitably makes errors, engage in "post-mortems" by asking it to reflect on its mistakes and then update your prompts or documentation. This iterative process of refinement transforms the AI into an increasingly intelligent and reliable partner. For PMs in larger organizations, Zevy suggests advocating for an "AI native" codebase with clear documentation, enabling the AI to assist with contained UI projects, even if shipping heavy database changes isn't yet feasible. By treating AI as a collaborative mentor and continuously improving its prompts, practitioners can significantly enhance their productivity and learning.

### Closing Thought

Zevy's insights underscore a profound shift: AI is not merely a tool for automation but a transformative partner that empowers individuals, especially non-technical product managers, to become builders. This era, he contends, is "the best time to be a junior" and a learner, where curiosity, optimism, and hard work, combined with strategic AI utilization, can unlock unprecedented value and innovation. By adopting Zevy's disciplined, iterative, and learning-centric approach, anyone can navigate the complexities of AI and actively shape the future of product creation.
