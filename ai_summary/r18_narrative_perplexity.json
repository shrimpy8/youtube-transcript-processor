Zevy, who started coding after watching YouTube videos on Bolt and Lovable during a trip to Japan around the release of Sonnet 3.5, shares how non-technical PMs can ship features independently, emphasizing a structured process that turns ideas into deployable code. This matters because, as Zevy puts it, \"AI just makes so much possible in the next coming years,\" enabling PMs, designers, and engineers—especially juniors—to become builders without traditional coding skills.\n\n### Key Ideas\n\nZevy begins by explaining his evolution from a ChatGPT \"CTO\" project to a full Cursor-based workflow powered by Claude Code, designed specifically for non-technical users afraid of code. He created a dedicated ChatGPT project as a \"complete technical owner\" with instructions to \"challenge me\" and avoid being a \"people pleaser,\" countering issues like sycophantic responses where GPT might agree to incorrect ideas, such as confusing Bun JavaScript with Zustand. This compartmentalized setup, using projects for context isolation across life facets like running and product work, prevented memory mix-ups and fostered planning before coding. Transitioning to Cursor, Zevy treats code as \"just words\" or files, allowing portability across tools, and recommends gradual exposure: start with GPT's simple UI for \"exposure therapy,\" progress to Bolt or Lovable for initial builds, then Cursor for control.\n\nThe core of Zevy's workflow unfolds through reusable slash commands in Cursor, demonstrated live while building fill-in-the-blank questions for his side project, Studymate—a platform where students upload PDFs to generate interactive quizzes via Gemini. Mid-development, he invokes \"/create-issue\" to quickly capture bugs or ideas in Linear, prompting Claude to ask brief clarifying questions and auto-generate structured tickets with TL;DRs, current state, and expected outcomes using MCP for tool integration. Later, \"/exploration-phase linear-88\" fetches the ticket, analyzes the codebase, and poses sophisticated questions on scope, data models, UX (like drag-and-drop), validation, and system prompts—mirroring an engineering manager's probe. Zevy stresses spending time here, answering thoughtfully to ensure deep understanding, and uses \"/learning-opportunity\" for 80/20 explanations of complex concepts, building his mid-level engineering knowledge incrementally.\n\nPlanning and execution follow seamlessly: \"/create-plan\" outputs a markdown file with TL;DR, critical decisions, status trackers, and concise steps, enabling model specialization—Claude's Composer for speed on simple tasks, Gemini 3 for UI. Zevy executes by tagging the plan file, watching Composer implement backend and frontend changes in minutes, far outpacing human timelines. He contrasts this with opinionated tools like Bolt, Lovable, Replit, Base44, or V0, which automate decisions (e.g., auto-adding Google Sign-In) but limit control for complex features like payments, pushing him to Cursor for \"cutting-edge abilities.\" Reviewing catches errors: manual QA first, then \"/review\" for self-review, plus parallel reviews in CodeX (GPT's \"hoodie coder\" who fixes bugs silently) and Composer, feeding outputs into \"/peer-review\" where Claude, as \"dev lead,\" debates and resolves issues, leveraging models' personalities—Claude collaborative and opinionated, Gemini artsy but erratic.\n\nThroughout, Zevy emphasizes constant iteration: post-mortems analyze failures, updating prompts, docs, or claude.md (system instructions) to prevent repeats, like refining tooling after bugs reveal misunderstandings. At Meta, he adapts minimally—making codebases \"AI-native\" with markdown explainers for UI tasks—while predicting role convergence: \"titles are going to collapse and responsibilities are going to collapse.\" He counters skill atrophy fears by framing AI as a non-judgmental thought partner, akin to a mentor, that amplifies PM craft through reps on strategy and onboarding, provided outputs are owned intentionally with context and style guides to avoid \"slop.\"\n\n### Practical Takeaways\n\nNon-technical PMs and engineers can immediately adopt Zevy's slash commands—downloadable from show notes—for Cursor: start ideas with \"/create-issue\" for fast Linear capture during flow; explore via \"/exploration-phase\" with codebase analysis and targeted questions; plan in structured markdowns; execute with model-specific tags (Composer for speed, Gemini for UI); review via multi-model \"/review\" and \"/peer-review\" debates; and iterate with \"/learning-opportunity\" for explanations plus post-mortems updating docs. For teams, make codebases AI-native with plain-text guides, collaborate on contained UI PRs, and use voice mode (e.g., Whisperflow) for natural ideation like briefing engineers. Juniors gain massive reps building solos, while all benefit from model strengths—Claude for communication, GPT for bug fixes—treating reviews as \"team leads fighting it out\" to ship robust code without deep expertise.\n\n### Closing Thought\n\nZevy's workflow democratizes building, proving non-technical PMs can ship revenue-generating apps like Studymate through deliberate planning, multi-model reviews, and relentless learning loops. By sharing prompts openly, he embodies his goal: not awe at his skills, but listeners opening laptops to build. In an era where \"you'll be replaced by someone who's better at using AI,\" this hands-on blueprint equips practitioners to thrive as versatile creators.\n\n(Word count: 912)","success":true}]}
