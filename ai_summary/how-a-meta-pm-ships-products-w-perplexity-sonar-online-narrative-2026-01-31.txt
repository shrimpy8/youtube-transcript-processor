### Opening

In this episode of the podcast, host Lenny interviews Zevy Arnowitz, a non-technical product manager at Meta who previously worked at Wix. Zevy shares his journey from having zero coding background—having studied music in high school and skipped tech units in the army—to building and shipping real products like his side project Studymate using AI tools. The core topic is Zevy's hands-on workflow for PMs, designers, and engineers to leverage AI like Cursor and Claude to build features without writing code, emphasizing practical techniques that make non-technical people effective builders.

### Key Ideas

Zevy explains how he starts projects slowly to overcome his fear of code, beginning with ChatGPT projects as a "CTO" persona prompted to own technical decisions, challenge ideas, and avoid people-pleasing behaviors common in base models like ChatGPT. "I created a CTO with the custom prompt of it being the complete technical owner of the project," he says, instructing it to push back rather than blindly agree, as ChatGPT once confused Bun JavaScript with Zustand and "riffed" incorrectly. This compartmentalized approach using projects—shared folders with custom instructions and knowledge bases—keeps contexts separate, preventing mix-ups like running advice bleeding into product reviews. He graduated from eager-to-code tools like Bolt and Lovable, which start building immediately but falter on complex tasks like payments, to Cursor powered by Claude Code for full control, noting "code is just words at the end of the day" and files can move between apps.

Central to Zevy's workflow are slash commands—reusable prompts saved in his codebase—that structure building like a production process. He demonstrates live adding fill-in-the-blank questions to Studymate, a platform for uploading study materials to generate interactive quizzes via Gemini. First, "/create issue" captures ideas mid-development in Linear format, quickly generating a ticket like STU88 with TL;DR, current state, and expected outcomes using Anthropic's MCP tool integration. Then "/exploration phase [Linear ticket]" has Claude analyze the codebase, ask clarifying questions on scope, data models, UX, validation, and prompts—questions like "Should blanks appear in a single sentence?" mirror engineering manager discussions. Zevy stresses spending time here: "I spend a lot of time going back and forth and understanding," contrasting it with vibe coding that skips planning.

Planning follows with "/create plan," producing a markdown file from a Twitter-sourced template with TL;DR, critical decisions, concise steps, and status trackers—ideal for splitting tasks across models like fast Composer for simple changes or Gemini 3.0 for UI. Execution tags the plan in Cursor's Composer, building the drag-and-drop interface in minutes. Review is multi-layered: manual QA first, then "/review" for self-review, plus parallel reviews in CodeX (GPT's tool) and Cursor's Composer, each catching unique bugs due to model personalities—Claude as collaborative CTO, CodeX as silent bug-fixer, Gemini as artsy but erratic designer. The ingenious "/peer review" pits them against each other: Claude as dev lead defends or fixes issues from "other team leads," sometimes sassily noting repeats "this has been raised for the third time... this is by design." Finally, "/update docs" introspects failures, updating prompts and docs to prevent repeats, turning post-mortems into productivity hacks.

Zevy personifies models to play to strengths: Claude for communication, CodeX for tough bugs, Gemini for design, enabling "time machine moments" like localizing Studymate Hebrew-to-English in two days while building a personal site in 90 minutes. At larger companies like Meta, he advises making codebases "AI native" with markdown explanations for navigation, suitable for PMs shipping contained UI via PRs to devs, though heavy migrations need technical leads. Titles and responsibilities will collapse as "everyone's going to become a builder," but start collaborative to overcome dev skepticism.

### Practical Takeaways

Non-technical PMs can copy Zevy's downloadable slash commands and Claude.md system prompt—starting in ChatGPT projects for exposure therapy, graduating to Cursor light mode, then full terminal. Use "/learning opportunity" for 80/20 explanations of confusing concepts like data models, building mid-level knowledge iteratively. For code review, always multi-model: self-review, peer reviews across Claude/CodeX/Composer, then peer review synthesis—non-technical users catch mistakes they miss alone. Post-build, prompt AI: "What in your system prompt or tooling made you make this mistake?" and update docs/slash commands, ensuring smarter future outputs without slop. In teams, propose AI-native codebases with plain-text guides; for side projects, voice-dictate issues like engineers, explore deeply, plan rigorously, and ship fast—turning weekends into revenue like Studymate's quizzes.

Junior PMs gain reps thinking big: strategy, marketing, onboarding on personal apps, while job hunting uses Claude projects as interview coaches with frameworks from Ben Arez, mock questions from Lewis Lynn's bank via Perplexity's Comet, and post-mock feedback loops. Own outputs by guiding with context and style, avoiding "AI slop" like unguided juniors regurgitating templates.

### Closing Thought

Zevy's workflow demystifies AI for non-technical builders, transforming terror of code into superpowers through structured prompts, multi-model reviews, and constant learning. It empowers PMs to prototype seriously, collaborate smarter, and outpace skeptics by owning technical ownership without coding. Ultimately, as he puts it, "it's not that you will be replaced by AI—you'll be replaced by someone who's better at using AI than you," making now the best time for curious, hardworking learners to build.
