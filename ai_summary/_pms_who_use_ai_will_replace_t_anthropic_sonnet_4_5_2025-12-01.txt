# AI Tools & Workflows

## **Perplexity (with Discussion/Reddit filter)**
- **Primary use**: Rapid user research by searching Reddit discussions and opinions
- **Key feature**: Filter to search only "discussions and opinions" rather than general web results
- **Workflow for market validation**:
  1. Ask initial research question (e.g., "Would families be interested in a smart fridge?")
  2. Review aggregated Reddit threads and sentiment analysis
  3. **Advanced technique**: Prompt Perplexity to "Create two agents—one pro, one against—and have them debate 20 times based on everything you read, then give me the minimum set of features needed to convince the against agent"
- **Output**: Prioritized feature list based on real user opinions, ready to use as input for PRD generation
- **Time saved**: Complete market research "within minutes" versus weeks with traditional UXR methods

## **Custom ChatGPT (AI Product GPT)**
- **Purpose**: Generate PRDs in consistent format and voice
- **Setup**: Created with a template of preferred PRD structure and personal writing style
- **Input**: Paste feature list from Perplexity
- **Output**: Complete PRD including problem statement, user personas, feature prioritization, architecture, and strategic thinking
- **Key benefit**: Provides "an incredible head start" rather than starting from blank template
- **Time investment**: Approximately 90 seconds for initial PRD generation

## **v0 by Vercel (Prototyping)**
- **Use case**: Turn PRDs into interactive UI prototypes
- **Input**: Paste entire PRD with prompt "Create the UI of a smart fridge given this PRD as an input"
- **Quality tip**: "The number of tweaks I had to do later on really got me overwhelmed and tired versus me starting spending some more time in order to make sure the input is very good"
- **Output features demonstrated**: Dashboard with temperature controls, door status widgets, power usage monitoring, recent activity logs, safety monitoring
- **Additional refinement**: Typically requires 5-10 follow-up prompts, plus adding images and animations for production-quality prototype

## **Veo (via Google Labs Flow)**
- **Purpose**: Create promotional videos from text descriptions
- **Process**: Paste features or narrative into Flow, select model quality (fast vs. high quality) and aspect ratio
- **Prompt format**: "Create a promotional clip for a couple using a smart fridge that has these features [paste feature list]"
- **Challenges encountered**: Overindexing on specific features (like door status), creative hallucinations (screens inside and outside fridge)
- **Host recommendation**: Use PRD narrative section (user story) rather than feature lists for more compelling video output

## **OpenAI Sora (with Cameo feature)**
- **Use case**: AI-generated video with custom avatars
- **Cameo setup**: Record yourself to create AI avatar; can add custom instructions like "always make me look good" or "always include [element]"
- **Advanced feature**: Can add other people's cameos (like Mark Cuban) to create multi-person scenes
- **Output quality**: Generated dialogue and scenarios automatically (e.g., two people discussing smart fridge features with natural conversation)
- **Fun applications**: Used for entertaining content and product demonstrations

## **NotebookLM (as AI Judge)**
- **Unique use case**: Judging demo day presentations at AI Product Management Bootcamp
- **Setup process**:
  1. Record audio of each pitch presentation
  2. Upload all audio files as separate sources
  3. Add custom instructions: "Select top three apps based on: innovation, impact, and storytelling"
  4. Generate audio overview with announcement of winners
- **Interactive mode**: "Live radio podcast where you call in"—can interrupt AI hosts to speed up or redirect conversation
- **Features**: Can generate both audio overviews and video overviews
- **Validation**: "AI really chooses the best demos indeed" when compared against human judges
- **Alternative applications**: Sales pitch competitions, hackathon judging, training evaluations

## **Tool Hopping Strategy**
- **Definition**: Strategic movement between specialized AI tools, using output from one as input for the next
- **Demonstrated sequence**: Perplexity (research) → ChatGPT (PRD) → v0 (prototype) → Veo/Sora (video) → NotebookLM (evaluation)
- **Key principle**: Format outputs to serve as inputs for next tool (e.g., requesting features from Perplexity specifically to paste into PRD generator)

# Product Management Techniques

## **Debate-Based Feature Validation**
- **Method**: Create two AI personas (pro and against your product idea) and have them debate extensively (20+ rounds) based on real user research
- **Purpose**: Overcome AI's tendency to be overly agreeable with ideas and validate whether features will achieve product-market fit
- **Output format**: Request "minimum set of features needed to convince the against agent" for actionable product requirements
- **Benefit**: More critical thinking and realistic assessment of product viability

## **Prototype-First Product Reviews**
- **Strategy**: Enter product reviews with clickable prototypes rather than just PRDs or slide decks
- **Value proposition**: "You communicate your vision and your passion more effectively versus here's a PRD that I turned into a deck"
- **Impact**: "It adds credibility. It adds value. It's just so much more effective"
- **Use case**: Especially valuable "at the product review" when seeking resource investment and stakeholder buy-in
- **Stakeholder experience**: Allow reviewers to "touch it, feel it, see it, move around" on their own devices

## **Narrative-Driven PRDs**
- **Recommendation from host**: Include a "narrative" section in PRDs—a story about an end user getting value or being successful with the product
- **Purpose**: "Forces you to take a very user centric lens on a list of features"
- **Application**: Use narratives (not just feature lists) as inputs for video generation tools to create more compelling demonstrations

## **Multi-Modal Stakeholder Influence**
- **Complete influence package**:
  1. Written PRD with strategic thinking
  2. Interactive clickable prototype
  3. Visual/video demonstration of user experience
  4. All deliverable in 15-20 minutes
- **Impact**: "Totally flipped product management and the process on its head and made it just much more compelling"

## **Real-World User Experience as Product Inspiration**
- **Example**: Discovering unknown features in existing products (smart fridge expiration notifications)
- **Validation approach**: Share observation on LinkedIn to gauge market interest (700 likes, 100 comments from PMs, 13 reposts)
- **Next step**: Use engagement and comments as input for AI-powered market research

# Skills & Competencies for PMs in AI Age

## **AI-Enhanced PM Mindset**
- **Core philosophy**: Shift from "pure AI PM" (working with scientists training models) to "AI enhanced PM" (using AI to be better at the job)
- **Focus areas**: "How can I be better at my job, have more impact, be more productive"
- **Career timeline**: Marilyn started as "pure AI PM" in 2017 working on speech recognition, then evolved to AI-enhanced PM when consumer AI tools emerged

## **Tool Experimentation & Selection**
- **Personal responsibility**: "It's just so important to explore and adapt and see which tools fit to your workflow"
- **Recognition**: "My choices might not be the same as other people's choices"
- **Experimentation approach**: Test multiple approaches to find optimal workflow (e.g., trying direct prompting vs. PRD-first for prototyping)

## **Meta-Prompting Skills**
- **Advanced technique**: "Use AI to help you write the best prompt" when another AI tool isn't delivering
- **When to restart**: "The best thing you can do is just kill that instance and start over" when iterations aren't working
- **Principle**: "Use AI on AI" rather than manually guessing optimal prompts

## **Critical Evaluation of AI Outputs**
- **Quality assessment**: Recognize when AI overindexes on certain features or produces unusable outputs
- **Iteration strategy**: Know when to refine prompts vs. when to start fresh
- **Input quality matters**: Investing time in high-quality inputs reduces downstream tweaking

## **Cross-Functional Communication**
- **New presentation format**: Moving beyond decks to interactive prototypes and video demonstrations
- **Stakeholder management**: Understanding how different formats (written, interactive, visual) influence decision-makers
- **Speed to value**: Ability to rapidly produce compelling artifacts that communicate vision

## **Competitive Awareness**
- **Critical insight**: "PMs that use AI are the ones that are going to take over the role of people that don't use AI"
- **Urgency**: The role of PM "has changed" and adaptation is not optional
- **Differentiation**: Speed and quality of output becomes competitive advantage
