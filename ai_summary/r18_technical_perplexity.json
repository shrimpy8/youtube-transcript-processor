Tools & Technologies Mentioned\n\n#### **Sonnet 3.5** (Anthropic)\n- **Category**: AI/ML — Large Language Model\n- **Use case**: Triggered speaker's interest in AI app building; watched YouTube videos of apps built with it using `Bolt` or `Lovable`\n- **Key features**: Not detailed beyond enabling non-technical app building\n- **Limitations**: Not discussed\n\n#### **Bolt** (App Builder)\n- **Category**: Developer Tools — AI app builder\n- **Use case**: Initial app building after returning from Japan; speaker opened account and started building immediately\n- **Key features**: Eager to write code per system prompt as a \"coding agent\"; fun for early project stages\n- **Limitations**: Becomes problematic for complex features like payments; lacks planning control, leading to gnarly bugs\n\n#### **Lovable** (App Builder)\n- **Category**: Developer Tools — AI app builder\n- **Use case**: Building apps demonstrated in YouTube videos; used in progression from `GPT` projects\n- **Key features**: Eager to write code like `Bolt`; progressed to include plan/ask modes\n- **Limitations**: Eager coding without planning causes issues in complex implementations like database changes\n\n#### **Cursor** (IDE)\n- **Category**: Developer Tools — AI-enhanced IDE\n- **Use case**: Current primary tool for building `Studymate` (student quiz app); full workflow including slash commands, code execution, and multi-model reviews; graduated to after outgrowing `Bolt`\n- **Key features**: Access to full codebase; supports slash commands as reusable prompts; integrates `Claude Code`; Composer model for fast execution; works with multiple models/apps on same project; code is \"just files\" portable across tools\n- **Limitations**: Intimidating for non-technical users initially; requires exposure therapy and gradual adoption (light mode to dark mode/terminal)\n\n#### **Claude Code** (Claude.dev)\n- **Category**: AI/ML — Coding interface\n- **Use case**: Powers `Cursor` chats; full workflow execution (issue creation, exploration, planning, review); self-review and peer review; runs within `Cursor`\n- **Key features**: Slash commands (`/create-issue`, `/exploration`, `/create-plan`, `/execute-plan`, `/review`, `/peer-review`, `/update-docs`, `/learning-opportunity`); MCP for tool use like Linear integration; challenges thinking per `claude.md` system prompt; opinionated yet collaborative \"CTO\"\n- **Key features**: Analyzes codebase, asks clarifying questions; generates markdown plans with status trackers, TLDR, critical decisions\n- **Limitations**: Makes mistakes requiring post-mortems; not discussed further\n\n#### **Codeex** (OpenAI competitor to Claude Code)\n- **Category**: AI/ML — Coding interface\n- **Use case**: Code review in multi-model workflow; pasted results into Claude's `/peer-review`\n- **Key features**: Built-in code review; catches different bugs than Claude; \"best coder\" personality (hoodie/sandals, non-communicative but fixes worst bugs)\n- **Limitations**: Not discussed\n\n#### **Composer** (Cursor model)\n- **Category**: AI/ML — Fast execution model in Cursor\n- **Use case**: Executes plans quickly (e.g., full feature in minutes); used for non-complex tasks\n- **Key features**: \"Ridiculously fast\" and keeps flow; reviews code rapidly\n- **Limitations**: Not discussed\n\n#### **Gemini 3** (Google)\n- **Category**: AI/ML — Large Language Model\n- **Use case**: UI work; splits plans into backend/frontend, reads plan for frontend implementation; used in `anti-gravity` (Google's Cursor competitor)\n- **Key features**: \"Unbelievable at UI\"; artsy \"crazy scientist\" personality produces beautiful designs despite scary process (e.g., temporary deletes)\n- **Limitations**: Terrifying thought process (deletes dashboard, edits DB unnecessarily)\n\n#### **GPT Projects** (ChatGPT)\n- **Category**: AI/ML — Shared chat folders\n- **Use case**: Starting point for non-technical users; created \"CTO\" with custom prompt as technical owner; compartmentalizes contexts (e.g., running vs PM work); exposure therapy before `Cursor`\n- **Key features**: Custom instructions, shared knowledge base; memory feature (annoying for mixed contexts); voice mode for ideation like talking to CTO\n- **Limitations**: People-pleaser \"sycophantic\" behavior (hallucinated `Bun JavaScript` similarity to `Zustand`); mixes irrelevant memories\n\n#### **Linear** (Issue Tracker)\n- **Category**: DevOps — Project management\n- **Use case**: `/create-issue` generates formatted issues (TLDR, current state, expected outcomes, priority); exploration pulls from tickets (e.g., \"linear 88\")\n- **Key features**: MCP integration auto-creates issues; accessible for solo use\n- **Limitations**: Generated issues ready for exploration, not direct building; lower quality for team contexts\n\n#### **Studymate** (Custom App)\n- **Category**: Web App — Student study platform\n- **Use case**: Weekend side project making money; upload PDF, select pages/difficulty, generates quizzes via `Gemini` (currently multiple choice; demoed adding fill-in-blank drag-drop)\n- **Key features**: Sends user data + system prompt to `Gemini`; deep explanations/hints; Hebrew-to-English localization in 2 days\n- **Limitations**: Only multiple choice initially\n\n#### **Whisperflow** (Dictation)\n- **Category**: Productivity — Voice input\n- **Use case**: Dictating during live build demo (e.g., feature specs)\n- **Key features**: Not detailed\n- **Limitations**: Not discussed\n\n#### **MCP** (Anthropic)\n- **Category**: AI/ML — Tool integration\n- **Use case**: Enables Claude to use tools like Linear for issue creation\n- **Key features**: Gives AI tool-using ability\n- **Limitations**: Not discussed\n\n### 2. Workflows & Processes\n\n#### **Full Vibe Coding Workflow** (Non-technical app building in Cursor/Claude)\n1. **Mid-development idea capture**: `/create-issue` (quick questions, formats Linear ticket via MCP: TLDR, current state, outcomes, priority, e.g., STU88 for fill-in-blank)\n2. **Exploration phase**: `/exploration linear 88` (fetches ticket, analyzes codebase/files, asks clarifying questions on scope/data/UX/validation/grading/prompts; CTO-like)\n3. **Create plan**: `/create-plan` (markdown file from Twitter template: TLDR, critical decisions, concise steps with status trackers; reference for multi-model execution)\n4. **Execute plan**: Tag plan file in Cursor/Composer (\"execute @plan.md\"); fast code gen (full features in minutes)\n5. **Manual QA**: Run app locally, test changes\n6. **Self-review**: `/review` (Claude reviews own code: critical/high/medium bugs)\n7. **Multi-model peer review**: Run `/review` or equivalent in `Codeex`/Composer; paste results into Claude `/peer-review` (\"dev lead\" resolves/explains/fixes; models \"fight it out\")\n8. **Update docs**: `/update-docs` (post-mortem: ask what in prompt/tooling caused errors, iterate docs/system prompts/`claude.md` for future agents)\n- **Tools**: `Cursor`, `Claude Code`, `Linear`, `Composer`, `Codeex`, `Gemini 3`\n- **Tips/Gotchas**: Gradual adoption (GPT projects → Bolt/Lovable → Cursor light/dark mode); manual QA first; constant post-mortems prevent repeated bugs; use `/learning-opportunity` for 80/20 explanations\n\n#### **Graduation Workflow** (Tool progression for non-technical)\n1. GPT Projects (CTO custom prompt: owns tech, challenges ideas)\n2. Bolt/Lovable (eager coding)\n3. Cursor (full control, multi-model)\n- **Tools**: `GPT Projects`, `Bolt`, `Lovable`, `Cursor`\n- **Tips/Gotchas**: Exposure therapy for code fear; outgrow when needing control (e.g., payments)\n\n#### **Multi-Model Execution** (Leverage strengths)\n- Split plan backend/frontend; `Gemini 3` for UI, `Composer` for speed, Claude for planning\n- **Tools**: `Gemini 3`, `Composer`, `Claude Code`\n- **Tips/Gotchas**: Models have personalities (Claude=collaborative CTO, Codeex=bug fixer, Gemini=UI artist); peer review mitigates weaknesses\n\n### 3. Tips, Techniques & Best Practices\n- Create \"CTO\" in `GPT Projects` with custom prompt: \"Own tech decisions, challenge me, not a people pleaser\" to avoid sycophancy/hallucinations\n- Use slash commands for repeatable automation (e.g., `/learning-opportunity` primes for 80/20 explanations as \"technical PM in making\")\n- `/exploration`: Deeply understand problem/codebase before building; answer clarifying questions prepared\n- Plans as markdown: Portable for multi-model; track status for future agents\n- Post-mortems after every bug/failure: Ask AI \"what in your prompt/tooling caused this?\" then update docs/`claude.md`/slash commands\n- Make codebase \"AI-native\": Add markdown files explaining structure/areas for agents (technical setup needed)\n- For teams: PMs ship contained UI via PRs to devs; don't do heavy DB migrations\n- Reduce slop: Guide AI with context/style (like briefing junior); own outputs; Cursor `/ds-slop`\n- Interview prep: Claude project as coach (feed Ben Arez frameworks, Lewis Lynn question bank via `comet`); AI mocks + human mocks; AI as candidate for perfect answers; post-mock feedback\n- Start slow: GPT → app builders → `Cursor`; be inquisitive learner\n\n### 4. Metrics & Numbers\n- Full feature build (fill-in-blank): \"Few minutes\" with `Composer`; \"couple bucks in AI credits\"\n- Localization (Hebrew-English `Studymate`): 2 days (would take dev team weeks)\n- Personal site: Domain live in 1.5 hours\n- `Studymate` fill-in-blank: 30% of tests; 6 answers for 2 blanks (2 correct)","success":true}]}
